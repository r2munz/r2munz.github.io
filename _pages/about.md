Scientist. 

Proud [RedHatter][redhat], working in the awesome [OpenShift AI][ocpai] team. Product Experience lead, I daily commit myself to make a better product with performing evidence-based analysis.

My journey started after getting my PhD in NanoTechnology in Delft, the Netherlands. Passionate about lasers and [exploding kittens][exploding-kittens]. When labs are not on fire is even better. I have produced  and characterized large batches of silicon nanoparticles as anode storage material in li-ion battery prototypes for electrical mobility. 
Big fan of sustainability, I tend to practice daily (environmental) cost savings, fixing and repairing, reducing waste and e-waste as much as I can. Bike lover, outdoor enthusiast, freediver and awesome cook (at least they say so).

My way through data science began when I took the responsibility of running the southern [WMO][wmo] weather station in the lovely island of Gozo. Collecting, validating, analysing, visualizing and submitting air quality data to the [NILU][nilu] datacenter for running climate change model at scale.
After a short period in a local polyethilene multilayer film maker [company][agriplast], during which I dealt with real time data acquisition, logging, visualization and alert, I have finally moved my big step towards the Open Source world.
